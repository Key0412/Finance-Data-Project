# Finance-Data-Project
Project using bank stock values from 2006 to 2016 meant to exercise the use of Python libraries - Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly

Data from bank stock values was obtained from the [Tiingo api](https://www.tiingo.com/) and used to extract information from 2006 to 2016, period in which one can visualize the 2008 financial crisis influence! The banks analysed were:  

* Bank of America
* CitiGroup
* Goldman Sachs
* JPMorgan Chase
* Morgan Stanley
* Wells Fargo  
  
The objective was to learn and exercise some capabilities of the following Python libraries:  
* Pandas
* Numpy  
* Matplotlib 
* Seaborn 
* Plotly  

This exercise is based on the "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" from John Portilla, at Udemy.  
You can find more information, graphics and codes in the [jupyter notebook file](https://github.com/Key0412/Finance-Data-Project/blob/master/03-Finance%20Project.ipynb).
